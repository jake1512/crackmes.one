this is my second crackme 
to get the right password its checking 5 things
1) the length need to be at least 8 characters(not including null terminator)
2)the password conhtains digits small letters and capital letter
3)the sum of digits need to be 17(not assci value the first digit 0 its equal 1 and the last 9 equal 10)
4)the sum of capital letters need to be 19(not assci the value of A its 1 and so...)
5)the sum of small letters need to be 25(not assci the value of a its 1 of b its 2 and so...)
other passwords are wrong
